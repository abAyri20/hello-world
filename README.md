# hello-world

Hello all!

I am an Electrical Engineering graduate with an interest in programming. I completed the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course through EDX online and have experience in C, PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am shifting my focus to Java and eventually work on mobile applications. But who knows, my mind will keep on wandering, so expect this page to change multiple times!
